## Introduction

### This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
● The encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.

## Questions try to answer:
#### 1- What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
#### 2-what is the overall appointment show-up vs. no show-up rate
#### 3-Is their a relation between age and other factor like (Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism)
